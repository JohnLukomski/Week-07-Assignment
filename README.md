# Week 07 Assignment
This week's Assignment is an identical copy of Week 06 Assignment editted to include an array of structures to hold the information in the three arrays. The structure used contains a string variable for the bowlers' names, an array of integers to hold each bowlers' scores, and finally an integer variable for the average score of each bowler. These three members each respectively replace the three arrays used previously. I have also added one extra bowling score to the example file "BowlingScores.txt", which has moved the number of bowling scores for each bowler from 4 to 5.
